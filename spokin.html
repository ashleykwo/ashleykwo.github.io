      <h3>About Spokin</h3>
      <p class="italic">Spokin is an online social network for people with food allergies. Like most other social platforms, the content is entirely user generated. Users are encouraged to connect with others by sharing their food allergy experience with restaurants, recipes, doctors, etc. Spokin is available to users in both desktop and mobile app platforms.</p>
      
      <hr>
      
      <p>This was a course project focused focused on user research and usability evaluation methods including user interviews, field observations, heuristic evaluation, walkthroughs, usability tests, and analytics.</p>
      <p>Our class had the opportunity to hear from two representatives about the Spokin app. We had the option to conduct user research using the company's app prototype to explore evaluation methods and potentially provide insights to app improvements and ways to expand Spokin's audience.</p>
      
      <hr>
      
      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>As Spokin's current audience mainly consisted of mothers of children with food allergies, our main goal was to determine how Spokin could be improved to provide greater value to a larger demographic, specifically college students.</p>
      
      <h4>Interviews</h4>
      <p>We interviews a total of 7 students, with 13 questions geared toward understand our chosen demographic.</p>
      <p>We then used an affinity diagram to organize our data.</p>
      <img src="images/affinity-clustering.jpg" alt="Affinity Mapping">
      <p>From our interviews, we found:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Almost half of interviewees do not rely on internet resources to find food accommodations since they did not find them informative enough</li>
        <li>People with common allergies seemed less worried about eating out that those with more uncommon allergies</li>
        <li>Many found it uncomfortable to tell others about their food restrictions for fear of being the "game-changer"</li>
        <li>Some people had friends and family with similar allergies and liked having people with similar food restrictions to eat with</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <p>From our findings, our group developed 2 personas and 3 scenarios for our target group.</p>
      <!-- MISSING PERSONAS -->
      <p><span class="bold">Scenario #1:</span> Thomas, who has a severe peanut allergy, makes plans to eat with one of his friends. His friend suggests a place that Thomas know does not cater to his allergy. Thomas feels embarrassed about asking for food accommodations, so instead he goes on the Spokin app to find a peanut-free restaurant and recommends he and friends go there instead.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Scenario #2:</span> Claire has a bad experience with a restaurant that she and her colleague goes to. She asks the waiter to make an accommodation for her sesame allergy, but finds sesame in her dish when it arrives. Unhappy, she request the food to be sent back and when she gets home, she writes a dissatisfied review of her experience at the restaurant.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Scenario #3:</span> Claire and her sister plan a vacation to Los Angeles which is coming up in a few days. They are both excited to be visiting a new city, but they both have concerns when it comes to eating out in a foreign city. Claire's sister decides that their best option is to research recommendations before they go and uses the Spokin app to find a place in the city to eat.</p>

      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>For our usability test, we used Spokin's website and app prototype. Though it was a simple interface with not too many featues, we were able to conduct tests on 4 tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a Profile</li>
        <li>Bookmark a Post</li>
        <li>Review a Restaurant</li>
        <li>Saying Thanks</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Testing Process</h4>
      <p>Though we were unable to conduct the tests in the same location, our group agreed on serval factors keep our environment consistent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brief the user on all points stated in the informed consent form and request permission to record voice and screens</li>
        <li>Record desktop screen and voice</li>
        <li>Record mobile screen and voice</li>
        <li>Engage friendly conversation that encourages open answers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Task One: Creating a Profile</h4>
      <p>You just moved to Chicago and heard Spokin is a good resource for finding restaurants with accommodations and other useful information regarding your allergy. You need to create a profile in order to use the website and app’s features, such as giving feedback, saving articles/posts, etc. Please show me how you would create your profile on the website: www.spokin.com.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>66.7% of participants easily created a profile</li>
        <li>33.3% created a profile with 1 - 2 errors</li>
        <li>Most participants had no major issues</li>
        <li>Some minor issues had to deal with the amount of icons present (too many options)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Task Two: Bookmark a Post</h4>
      <p>You were looking through your friend Sara’s recommendations on her profile and want to save one of the restaurants she reviewed and suggested called “Black Bottle.” Please show me how you would do this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>83.3% we able to complete the task quickly; all participants were able to complete the task with no errors</li>
        <li>Boomarking appeared intuitive for most users, because they were all familiar with the icon</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Task Three: Review a Restaurant</h4>
      <p>You went to “Bar Mesculine” and you did not like staff there because they were unhelpful with your allergy accommodations, so you want to let other users know about your experience. Please show me how you would do this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Half the users were able to write a review with no major problems</li>
        <li>33.3% had difficulty but were able to complete the task</li>
        <li>One participant could not complete the task</li>
        <li>A participant noted they thought it was strange that they could not write a review when clicking on the restaurant's page, as they could only review a restaurant on the home screen</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Task Four: Saying Thanks</h4>
      <p>You were reading Sara’s reviews and several of them appeared to be very helpful to you as you were able to find a great place for the dinner. Please show me how you would let her and other users know that Sara’s profile is valuable and useful and people can trust it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many found liking a post to be easy</li>
        <li>The button appeared to be understandable, but difficult to find</li>
        <li>Some participant suggest replacing the button with a star rating system</li>
        <li>One user pointed out that rather than "Saying Thanks" to show that Sara is reputable person</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Suggestions and Findings</h3>
      <p>The overall feedback of the website and app was positive.</p>
      <p>Many found it simple to create a profile and found the creation of an "emoji" fun. However, the word "avatar" felt more appropriate description. Others suggested the option to add their own photo.</p>
      <p>Some users found it odd that there was no option to write a review on the restaurant's page, rather they could only write it one their homepage</p>
      <p>Some suggestions to the app included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrating Yelp to the website and app</li>
        <li>Clarifying the "Say Thanks" button on posts</li>
        <li>Showing a list of people who recommended the post, with the people you follow and your followers appearing first</li>
        <li>Having a place to view saved posts</li>
      </ul>
